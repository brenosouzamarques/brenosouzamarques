### OlÃ¡! ðŸ˜„

I'm Breno, a master's student at the Graduate Program in Medicine and Health, Federal University of Bahia, Brazil.

Human cognition fascinates me, especially in the field of mental health. I'm currently working as a researcher at the [Neuropsyhopharmacology Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Laboratory-of-Neuropsychopharmacology-Lucas-C-Quarantini).
