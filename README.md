### OlÃ¡! ðŸ˜„

I'm **Breno Souza-Marques, a master's student** at the Graduate Program in Medicine and Health, Federal University of Bahia, Brazil. I'm currently working as a researcher at the [Neuropsyhopharmacology Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Laboratory-of-Neuropsychopharmacology-Lucas-C-Quarantini), focused on the neurocognitive effects of ketamine and its enantiomers. Research interests are broadly centered on human cognition through the lens of neuroscience and computational modelling.

I have previously worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Clinical and Cognitive Neuropsychology Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Neuroclic-UFBA-Neander-Abreu), taking part in data collection, neuropsychological testing, data analysis and manuscript writing in different projects, from school-aged children environmentally exposed to airborne manganese, to adults being treated with new protease inhibitors in chronic hepatitis C. Results from projects I've been a part of are available in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WCNF2WYAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR).

Now, all projects are run in **R**. To increase transparency and work towards Open Science, codes for recent analyses in projects I am working on will be publicly shared here, or at my [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) profile, whenever possible.
