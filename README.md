### OlÃ¡! ðŸ˜„

I'm **Breno, a master's student** at the Graduate Program in Medicine and Health, Federal University of Bahia, Brazil.

I'm a psychologist fascinated by human cognition and statistical modelling, especially in the field of mental health. I'm currently working as a researcher at the [Neuropsyhopharmacology Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Laboratory-of-Neuropsychopharmacology-Lucas-C-Quarantini), focused on the neurocognitive effects of ketamine and its enantiomers.

I have previously worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Clinical and Cognitive Neuropsychology Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Neuroclic-UFBA-Neander-Abreu), taking part in data collection, neuropsychological testing, data analysis and manuscript writing in different projects, from school-aged children environmentally exposed to airborne marganese, to adults being treated with new protease inhibitors in chronic hepatitis C. Results from projects I've been a part of are available in [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WCNF2WYAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR).

Most of my analysis is done in **R**. In an effort to increase transparecy and work towards Open Science, codes for recent analysis in projects I am working on are publicly shared here, together with anonymized data whenever possible.

I'm currently studying linear algebra and will soon move to calculus, as prerequisites to a deeper understanding of probability theory. Bayesian modelling and the Pyhton language will be learned latter this year, hopefully. I will share some code in the form of tutorials as I move forward in this journey.
